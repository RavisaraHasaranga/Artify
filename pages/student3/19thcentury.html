        <p>Neoclassicism was the preeminent painting movement in Europe in 1800, during the beginning of the 19th
            Century. The
            decorative movement, which included the ornamental arts, sculpture, and architecture, had evolved in the
            18th century,
            long before the artistic movement.</p>

        <p>The emergence of science as a profession and two massive industrial revolutions, which established the time
            as the age
            of the machine and had a profound effect on every level of society while enhancing nearly every aspect of
            daily life,
            also contributed to the period's enormous social change and urbanization. It was the same with art,
            particularly painting,
            in the 19th century. The move from historical "Old Masters" style paintings to the emergence of Modernism
            over a century was marked by significant changes.
            Formerly, artists were hired to create works for a patron or an institution; nevertheless, it wasn't until
            the 19th
            century that they truly began to create works on their own initiative, pursuing fresh personal interests.
