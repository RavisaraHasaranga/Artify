                        smiling? A number of theories for the former have been proffered over the years:
                        That she’s the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del
                        Giocondo (ergo, the work’s alternative title, La Gioconda); that she's Leonardo’s
                        mother, Caterina, conjured from Leonardo's boyhood memories of her; and finally,
                        that it's a self-portrait in drag. As for that famous smile, its enigmatic quality has
                        driven people crazy for centuries. Whatever the reason, Mona Lisa’s look of
                        preternatural calm comports with the idealized landscape behind her, which
                        dissolves into the distance through Leonardo’s use of atmospheric perspective</p>

                    <p class="details">painting by Hiëronymus Bosch completed c. 1490–1500, which is representative of Bosch at his mature best. It depicts the earthly paradise with the creation of woman, the first temptation, and the Fall.

                      Bosch’s work is full of fantastical beasts, surreal landscapes, and the depiction of the evils of humankind. He was born into a family of artists in the Dutch town of ’s-Hertogenbosch, from where he takes his name, and spent most of his life there. In 1481 he married a lady 25 years his senior; it was a propitious move on the artist’s behalf for, by the time of his death, he was among the richest and most respected of ’s-Hertogenbosch’s residents. A sign of the artist’s elevated social position was his membership in The Brotherhood of Our Lady, a conservative religious group that was also responsible for his early commissioned work.</p>

                    <p class="details">Woman with a Pearl Necklace by Johannes Vermeer is a seventeenth-century Northern European painting. Painted in oils on canvas, Johannes Vermeer portrayed a young Dutch woman, most likely of upper-class-descent, dressing herself with two yellow ribbons, pearl earrings, and a pearl necklace. As a very popular artist of the 17th century, the Dutch Golden Age, Vermeer depicted many women in similar circumstances within interior, domestic scenes. The same woman also appears in The Love Letter and A Lady Writing a Letter.</p>
